# colorize images -WordPress function
If you for some reason need to automatically convert original image to colorized one, then I'm what you were looking for all this time.

## What it does?
This function clones the original image...

![Original image](https://github.com/svirmasalo/colorize-images-wordpress-snippet/images/last-rays.jpg)

...And turns it into this:
![Colorized copy](https://github.com/svirmasalo/colorize-images-wordpress-snippet/images/last-rays_colorized.jpg)

OR what ever color you wish.

## Where to use it?
Tested and used within WordPress theme functions.php -file, but it should work fine within any php code.

### Notes
This function is included in [Dobby, the humble starter theme](https://github.com/svirmasalo/Dobby).
